# ReQuSim

ReQuSim is a simulation platform for quantum repeaters. It allows to evaluate
quantum repeater strategies for long-distance quantum key distribution and
entanglement distribution protocols, while taking into account arbitrary
error models.


## Installation

You can install ReQuSim into your python environment from the Python Package
Index:

```
pip install requsim
```

As with all python packages this can possibly overwrite already installed
package versions in your environment with its dependencies, which is why
installing it in a dedicated virtual environment may be preferable.

## Documentation

The Documentation is hosted on [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/) and
includes some example setups of how to use ReQuSim to simulate a simple
key distribution protocols.
