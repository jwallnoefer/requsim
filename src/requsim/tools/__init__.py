"""A module to help working with requsim.

The tools module collects useful ways to set up and interact with requsim
simulations, but which are not directly tied to the core functionality (and
is therefore not automatically imported with "import requsim").
It also includes useful functions for evaluating the results from the simulation
and a collection of useful pre-defined instances of requsim objects that are
regularly used, e.g. for error models.
