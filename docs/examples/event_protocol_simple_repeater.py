"""Using the event system to run a simple repeater protocol.

This variant accurately uses timing data and collects information about the
generated long-distance states. The protocol decisions are made at a global
level, with the protocol looking at the whole state of the world and deciding
what to do next.

The world setup and protocol can be described as follows:

Stations A and B want to establish entangled pairs via a repeater station at
the middle point between them.
The middle station has a mechanism to create entangled pairs and a quantum
memory (can hold one qubit for each side). The middle station will continously
try to establish pairs between itself and both A and B. After it has established
a pair with both A and B, an entanglement swapping operation is performed to
connect A and B. Repeat until the desired number of pairs has been established.

Error model: The entangled pairs are considered to be perfect upon generation.
The quantum memories introduce a time-dependent dephasing noise while a qubit
sits in memory. The Bell measurement to perform the entanglement swapping is
assumed to be perfect.

For a detailed explanation of this type of protocol see e.g.
D. Luong, L. Jiang, J. Kim, N. LÃ¼tkenhaus; Applied Physics B 122, 96 (2016)
Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.02811
The protocol in this example corresponds to the 'simultaneous' variant of the
protocol discussed there, but with a simpler error model.
